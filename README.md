# SFML-static-project
A statically linked SFML project template. It's using sublime text, but if you make a .bat file and put the command inside it (located in the .sublime-project file) you can do the same thing. Just download it and you're good to go!

You can download it to use for anything, its a template, so why should you have to?

Notice: You have to make the following folders because github removes them:
bin bin/debug bin/release
